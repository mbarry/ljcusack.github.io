I've pushed a new theme, one that I've taken from 'Vida' and edited to
mine own liking. It was pretty finicky in doing so and things still
aren't quite right with it. But it's something other than the default so
that's okay.

I've learned that I will need to continue blogging for one of my
courses, so I hope to learn to write some sort of script that I can use
to transfer my blog posts from there to here. A little backstory: for my
first computing course we were required to blog, so that got me in the
habit of blogging and which is why I set this page up.
