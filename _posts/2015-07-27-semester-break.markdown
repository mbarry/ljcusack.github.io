For the break I had two main goals I wanted to achieve. One: to move to
Sydney close to uni, and two: get an internship for the summer. Moving
ended up being the main priority and took up quite a bit of time, but I
did it and I'm pretty happy about it. I'm close to uni, and hopefully
close to work whenever I get it. With the help of friends I've already
found some cafe work.

The other objective is still a work in progress as I've been updating
my linkedin portfolio and resume.


# What I learned/achieved this break
* Git (on [lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com))
* Created this blog
* Registered a domain name [ljcusack.id.au](http://www.ljcusack.id.au)


# This blog
Purpose: to reflect on whatever I'm learning at that point in time as I
venture through my CS degree, and any achievements I wish to note.


# Next semester
This next semester I'm doing two math courses and two computing courses,
the latter I'm a lot more excited for. I hope to learn program
implementation design in one course and in the other learn useful
programming tools, eg. version control, grep, and other unix programs. I also hope to build upon my C skills which haven't been put to much use during
the break, mainly because of the move.
